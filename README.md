gui-check
========

The gui-check library enables developers to write automated user interface tests for Java programs. JavaFX and Swing are currently supported. Tests are written in pure Java and use the popular JUnit framework. All Java IDEs have some support for JUnit tests which makes the creation, execution and debugging of gui-check tests very easy.  
Having the tests in the development environment right beside the product code increases the acceptance of automated user interface tests among developers. Additionally, gui-check tests may be executed on an integration test server.
